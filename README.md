TransAIde is a plugin for the Trados Studio (CAT tool).
TransAIde is designed to allow translators easily working with various GenAI in any way (chat, projects, API, agentic AI, variuos automation scenarios). 
The plugin is in an early stage of development and not all planned functions have been programmed yet.

The basic features of the plugin:

Functions available as dialog boxes called from the ribbon in Trados Studio:
- Export source text from Trados Studio to a text file (option to select the range and type of segments to be exported)
- Export source text, translation and basic segment information from Trados Studio to a JSON file (option to select the range and type of segments to be exported)
- Export of terms from the termbase that appear in the translated file/project (separate export of terms with required and forbidden translations)
- Import of GenAI translations into Trados Studio in text form (option to select the range of segments into which the translation will be imported)
- Import of new translations and revised translations after review together with comments from GenAI to Trados Studio as a JSON file

Function available as ViewPart in the Editor view in Trados Studio:
- Display of source text, translation obtained from GenAI and/or translation revised by GenAI during review together with comments on changes for the active segment from a JSON file

The most important planned functions:
- Export of target text (translation) from Trados Studio to a text file (possibility to select the range and type of exported segments). For linguistic correction or rephrasing of the target text by GenAI.
Export of source and target text (translations) from Trados Studio to a text file, e.g. in CSV format or as alternating lines.
Export of terminology from online termbases. Currently, only offline (local) termbases are supported.
